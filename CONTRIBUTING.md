# Contributing
First off - if you're interested in contributing to the project, thank you!
There's a small set of guidelines that should be followed when opening issues or pull requests that are outlined here.

## Issues
When reporting a bug, please make sure to include a detailed description of how to reproduce the problem.
The more detailed, the simpler it is for the maintainers to reproduce it locally and figure out how to fix it.


## Pull Requests
If someone else is already working on a task, avoid starting your own branch / fork to work on it.
Communicate with the author instead, or branch / fork off their current work and ask them to merge in your changes.

For pull requests that you're working on with multiple other people, avoid force pushing unless communicated.

Try to fix linting errors locally before committing to avoid creating "fix linting issues" commits.
A [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) can be useful for this.

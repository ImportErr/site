  <h1>Edit your profile</h1>
  <p>
    Want to edit your username or discriminator?
    As we get this information from Discord's OAuth 2 provider, please
    change it there and log out and back in to update
    the OAuth 2 data that we have on our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can set the <b>Restrict processing</b>
    flag below and request a manual change of your data if
    there is any issue with this - however, keep in mind that
    we may refresh this information from OAuth, overriding your changes.
  </p>

    Not happy with just making your profile invisible?
    <strong>
      You can delete your profile by going <a href="{% url 'profiles:delete' user.id %}">here</a>.
    </strong>
    Don't worry, it's going to prompt you before it actually happens,
    and show you what exactly it's going to delete.

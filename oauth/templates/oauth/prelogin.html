  <h1>Your Information</h1>
  <p>
    When you sign in to our site, we get a bunch of information
    from Discord's OAuth provider. Additionally, when you submit
    content to our site, we also get a bunch of data from you.
    The following table outlines <strong>what</strong> we collect,
    <strong>when</strong> we collect it and <strong>why</strong> we collect it.
  </p>

  <table class="striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>what</th>
        <th id="when">when</th>
        <th>why</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Discord ID, username, discriminator, avatar hash,
          whether you're a bot, have your account verified,
          and whether you have 2FA enabled
        </td>
        <td>

        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Guild ID, name, icon hash, permissions, and
          whether you're the owner on the guilds you're
          a member of

    content generated by you on the site that isn't strictly
    necessary for proper operation of the website or retained for
    moderation reasons.
